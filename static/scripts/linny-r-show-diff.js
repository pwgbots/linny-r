/*
Linny-R is an executable graphical specification language for (mixed integer)
linear programming (MILP) problems, especially unit commitment problems (UCP).
The Linny-R language and tool have been developed by Pieter Bots at Delft
University of Technology, starting in 2009. The project to develop a browser-
based version started in 2017. See https://linny-r.org for more information.

This JavaScript file (linny-r-show-diff.js) comprises only the function that
retrieves HTML code from the browser storage. This HTML code is placed there
by the File manager after comparing the current model (A) with another model
(B) loaded for comparison.
