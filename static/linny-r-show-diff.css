/*
Linny-R is an executable graphical specification language for (mixed integer)
linear programming (MILP) problems, especially unit commitment problems (UCP).
The Linny-R language and tool have been developed by Pieter Bots at Delft
University of Technology, starting in 2009. The project to develop a browser-
based version started in 2017. See https://linny-r.org for more information.

This Cascading Style Sheets file (linny-r-show-diff.css) defines the styles
for the HTML file that displays the differences between the current Linny-R
model (A) and another model (B) that is loaded by the File manager.
