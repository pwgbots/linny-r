Linny-R is an executable graphical specification language for (mixed integer)
linear programming (MILP) problems, especially unit commitment problems (UCP).
The Linny-R language and tool have been developed by Pieter Bots at Delft
University of Technology, starting in 2009. The project to develop a browser-
based version started in 2017. See https://linny-r.org for more information.
