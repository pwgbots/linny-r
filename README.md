<p>Linny-R is an executable graphical specification language for mixed integer 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming" target="_blank">linear programming</a> (MILP) problems, especially
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_commitment_problem_in_electrical_power_production" target="_blank">unit commitment problems</a> (UCP) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_expansion_planning" target="_blank">generation expansion planning</a> (GEP).</p>

The graphical language and WYSIWYG model editor are developed by **Pieter Bots** at Delft University of Technology.
 
Originally implemented in Delphi Pascal, it is now developed in HTML CSS+JavaScript (Node.js) so as to be platform-independent.

You can play with the most recent release of Linny-R on
<a href="https://sysmod.tbm.tudelft.nl/linny-r" target="_blank">this server hosted at TU Delft</a>.    
Note that this server imposes restrictions on solver time and the total number of blocks it will solve per run.    
If you install Linny-R on your own machine, no such restrictions apply.

Documentation for Linny-R is still scant, but it is growing. You can contribute yourself (in "wiki fashion")
